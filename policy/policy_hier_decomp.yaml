Instructions: |
  -  help me build a software application that can decode morse code using best know methods.
  - I will need to know what to use for the front end, signal processing, and decoding.
  - Break down the process into detailed step by step instructions building on part of the application at a time using best practices.
  - The individual steps will be used as GPT-4 prompts to generate the code.

Context: |
  - Application must be robust and hanle morse audio signal with Noise, Interference, Fading, Multipath Distortion. 
  - Application can process morse code be between 10 and 30 WPM

Interface: |
  - Application will read audio signal from wav file.
  - Output the decoded morse code to the console.
  - UI will be a simple command line interface.

Architecture: |
  - Use Python for the application.
  - Use a configuration driven design pattern.
  - Each steps knows there is a global object dictionary that can lookup a parameter give a name. Application initialization will  load this dictionary from YAML file.
